## Solution

### Ex. 1A

1. Creators are people who create things, consumer are people who consume things
2. Adverts or advertisements - a way of advertising product, so you consider buying it
3. Audience - people who watch or listen some show
4. Content - information which people are interested in.
5. subscribe - give information to service, that you are interested in the content, so it will notify you when new video came out
6. Investment - a wise spending which will pay back later

### Ex. 4A

1. 2005
2. adverts
3. subscribers
4. consumers

### Ex.4B

1. Kids playing in bedrooms
2. TV programme makers
3. shooting, editing, lighting, production
4. More views = more subscribers = more money
5. That creative community has lost a lot because of the internet - creative peaople can't make a living from their creations

### Ex.5

1. The clip showed balanced opinions about the Youtube, both pros and cons were discussed
2. There were probably just entertainment content, so kids were literally messing around and if it makes a persone smile, the video had done it's purpose
3. Well, I don't watch TV at all, Youtube is a default for me. It's a great place to learn, gather information, relax, have some fun and even watch TV programs. I think it is a future of TV

### Ex.6A

I already have an account and it has my default nickname since i think age of 12 - Killer. It is usually taken so I take advantage of |Il similarity. There are no videos there because I don't have time and don't use social media. I like my privacy.  
But if I were to start my own channel, it could be full of let's plays(videos where I play games) or maybe something entertaining about my studying.  
Target audience would be people around my are, which want to see somebody like them struggle and overcome difficulties both in games and studying.  
I am not sure how I can be special in this vast, endless field of Youtube, but some people find my humor kind of nice and I haven't seen that many funny programmers.  
I think I will star in my videos, but maybe friends I play with may be there as well.  
Competition is just insane, there is just too many people in the world. My main rivals will be other programmers and games, but I have seen one Youtube chanel I am subscribed to do quite the opposite of rivaling(is this a word?). The owner of this channel collaborates with other content makers and make videoes together, it allowes them to share their viewers and possibly gain a lot of subscribers quickly.  
I possibly can upload each day videoes without heavy montage, with me playing games, or be more advanced in this field and go for one vieo per week with neat montage.

### Ex.6B

They mentioned name 'One Hour Wonders', their channel will be about local places. Target audience: tourists, local people. It's special because it will show what you can do in an hour in different locations to kill an hour. Local people will host videoes. It was done before but not with the angle an hour to kill. They talked about one per day, but that seems impossible to me. Just getting to one city in one day is already impressive, then showing the places(provided they know what to show) and recording. There may be no locals, bad weather, stuff not working during weekends and don't forget the editing.

### Ex.6C

I heard all of them

### Ex.8A

I think that their topic is a very important one and if people care about their lives in future, they will watch those videos to prevent the planet from being destroyed. If the funding company is wise and the price is not too big, they will surely get the funding.

### Ex.8B

We are looking for funding to make a tutorial videos about programming. We intend to educate people in the most popular field. The videos will be presented by senior developers and authors of channel. We will upload new videows each week. Our target audience is teenagers, kids and maybe adult programmers looking to learn new technologies.
We thankk you for your attention and if you think our idea is worth investing, please don't hesitate to contact us.
