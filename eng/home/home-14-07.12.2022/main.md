## Solution

### Ex.1A

1. First of all, it's their way to advertise themselves. It allows users to see range of products, services and just about site in general. Second of all, it may be the product company offer. Like youtube, there is no youtube shop or department or anything. Their main product is their site itself.

### Attached task

I believe minimalism is the most promising. It keeps the design simple to emphasize essentials, and content user's needs,  then going hardcore colors on them. It doesn't mean it looks bad, one of the most powerful web frameworks out there, angular, has an additional framework called angular material to help style the website, and it uses minimalistic styles. Most of google related web pages are minimalistic, and since google has such a huge success, minimalism may just be one of many reasons why.
