As a developer, I often find myself looking for a piece of documentation i desparetly need to fix something. If it is a major company's web site, it is usually a well designed and easy to navigate. It often comes with dark theme because programmers work in dark mode without seeing daylight, and bright colors can be painful to see. These sites include easy navigation and lots of examples in special code block.

One of the best examples of this is Angular Material documentation site. You can find it [here](https://material.angular.io/components/card/overview). As you can see, you can choose dark mode there is navigation on top of the site to core components of site and a sidenav to navigate core comonents themselves. Also themes they offer are quite neat and pleasent to see. This website is build using Angular and Angular Material, the very thing it shows documentation for. It is also adaptive for mobile devices, which makes it easy to observe from phone. I wish all websited were like this one.

It is frustrating to see an old website without dark mode and no animations what so ever. The colors don't blend together and it looks unnatural. Phone mode is not existant. Last poorly designed site I remember is [microcap](http://www.spectrum-soft.com/index.shtm) download page. Now when I think about it... It is not poorly designed, it is just old, build using old standarts and using old technologies. Previous example is build using modern framework which continues to expand even now.
