## Solution

### M1

#### Unit 1

##### Ex. 1, p. 10

###### 1

Unfortunately, due to my age, I did not participate in any conferences. I have seen presentations given to other students and me about different topics during my internship in Torun, but I would hardly call this a conference. As much as I want to try and give a presentation at a conference about a topic I am interested in, I have not done it yet, but I believe that one day I will be on stage, probably speaking English.

###### 2

Most of the information about events I am interested in comes via Email. I have recieved notification about conferences about different programming languages and approaches.

###### 3

I look for topics, a brief explanation of conference topics, date and location where the conference will take place.

##### Ex. 2, p. 10

|   |   A   | B     |   C   |   D   | E     |
|:-:|:-----:|-------|:-----:|:-----:|-------|
| 1 | True  | False | True  | False | False |
| 2 | True  | False | False | False | True  |
| 3 | False | False | False | True  | False |

##### Ex. 4, p. 11

1. To notify readers about the upcoming conference and its topic
2. It's Theme, set of topics, acceptance
3. Prepositions, articles, modal verbs
4. Considering my English knowledge as sufficient and denying the possibility of complete chaos, which may have been removed and replaced with blank lines, I am quite certain that the text can be understood
