## The video  

I mean yes, but come on. It's like saying that every side effect of modern medicine will happen and will kill you. Of course there are some problems with virtual meetings but real one's have them as well. While people have connection issues and some users may have problems signing in, look at real life. Drive 1 hour to work each day, while you can be staying at home doing your job. Or maybe the speaking at the same time? This does not happen only in virtual meetings. But rockets are not flying around you and you have 0 chance of spreading deseases.
