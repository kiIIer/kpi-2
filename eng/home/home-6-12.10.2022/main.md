## Solution

### Ex.1A

1. That's easy one. It's me. But seriously it's a persone who is very experienced in some field but it's commonly used with internet security to talk about person who can break security mesures. Sometimes illegaly.
2. It's very difficult due to required knowledge about different apps, protocols, security. But perople who can do it are legends and they really exist.
3. Firewall, anti-virus and no dumb actions.

### Ex.1B

1. d
2. c
3. a
4. b

### Ex.2A

All of them. I'm that good XD

### Ex. 2B

1. Internet is an essential part of the world. We store data on computers connected to internet, we use online banking, personal information, etc. Just like a burgler can steal your money from your home if it has no alarm or protenction. Hacker can steal money from you via internet if you are unprotected.
2. It showes if https is used and it allows you to manage cookies
3. They use SSL
4. They are already protected. There is no need to protect them more. The two side encryption works with https protocol and nobody can read your emails. But sure, you can use encryption program cuz it was mentioned.
5. Password, firewall, encryption
6. With infected usb, disk, just infected computer in the same network, internet
7. Email attachments, the example I provided in my presentation was about it

1. password
2. firewall
3. hacker
4. viruses

Like I said before, don't do dumb things on the internet. Like Nigeria prince asks you for money and said that he will shorlty return it. Or like in Ann's case: hi, we are the web site you are viewing, please send us all your data, so we can give you a coupon. Did she just sent it by email? Like  

```
Dear Sir/Madam  
I am writing to give you my email and password.  
Email: hi@hi.com

Best wishes.  
```
