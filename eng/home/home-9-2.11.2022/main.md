### Neon

As a programmer and quite game addicted person, I like the futuristic looks of neon style with all kinds of glowing things, shapes, and just vibrant features. The famous game Cuperpunk2077 and anime released shortly after Cyperpunk Edge runners became very popular and use neon-like style.

I mean, just look at that. Seems cool and future like? That's exactly why I love this style.

And another example. There is just something appealing in those bright colors flashing in the middle of the night.
